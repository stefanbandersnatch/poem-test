Only half of a rainbow is a lonely thing

Green addition!

Blue addition!
Purple addition!
But what about unicorns? Does not a unicorn bleed when you cut it?
And ponies are important, just ask Seinfeld!

And what about imagination?
That people wish on,
once some time ago
there were writers a few
who spoke of things anew.

Let us see a new color.
Its name shall be evergreen
but its nature blackish
and its queue to the back of the rainbow
for it shall never be seen.
